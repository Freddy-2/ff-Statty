## ff-Statty

# Background and Overview
    I have always been a huge football fan. My interest in fantasy football came later.
    I've wanted a tool to see a player's stats alongside their fantasy points and to compare it with top and average players,
    so why not make one! 
    
# Functionality and MVP Features
    Will be able to search by player name and see their historical statistics and fantasy points.
    
# Architecture and Technologies
    Javascript, HTML, CSS, D3.js
    Going vanilla to make it work and look great.
    
    SleeperBot's API 
    This is going to be used to get the stats and player information
