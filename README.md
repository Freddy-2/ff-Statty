# Background and Overview
    I have always been a huge football fan. My interest in fantasy football came later
    I've wanted a tool to see a player's stats alongside their fantasy points and to compare it with top and average players, so I made one! 
    
# Functionality and MVP Features
* You are able to search by player name and see their 2018 statistics and fantasy points
* There is a autocomplete function on the player search
* Filtered out all defensive players and players that had no points on the season
* Bar Chart changes when you change the player

    
# Architecture and Technologies
## Javascript, HTML, CSS, D3.js
* D3 is used here to make the bar chart
* CSS for style, JS and HTML to make it all work together

## SleeperBot's API 
* This was be used to get the stats and player information
