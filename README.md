## ff-Statty
# Background and Overview
    I have always been a huge football fan. My interest in fantasy football came later.
    I've wanted a tool to see a player's stats alongside their fantasy points over the course of multiple seasons for a while
    so why not make one! 
    
# Functionality and MVP Features
    Will be able to search by player name and see their historical statistics and fantasy points.
    Default will be 3 years of historical data. 
    Will be able to see stats for one year if specified. 
    If more than one year of stats is displayed, there will be averages on the bottom row.
